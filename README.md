**MEMBER GROUP SECTION CONFIGS**
From the commands and outputs you've provided, it seems that adding your user to the `docker` group didn't take effect immediately, or there might be some other issue preventing the non-`sudo` `docker ps` command from showing the running containers.

Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Confirm Group Membership**: Ensure that your user is indeed a member of the `docker` group. You can check this with the following command:

    ```bash
    groups ${USER}
    ```

    The output should list `docker` as one of the groups. If not, you may have to log out and log back in, or even restart your system, for the group change to take effect.

2. **Use `newgrp` Properly**: The `newgrp` command is used to log into a new group, changing the current group ID during a login session. If you run `newgrp docker`, you should be in a new shell session where your primary group is set to `docker`. Run `docker ps` without `sudo` in this new shell session to see if it now shows the containers.

3. **Check Docker Daemon**: Ensure the Docker daemon is running and accessible by your user without `sudo`. You can test this with:

    ```bash
    docker info
    ```

    If you can't access Docker without `sudo`, even after adding your user to the `docker` group, there might be a problem with the Docker daemon configuration.

4. **Running Containers**: Your `sudo docker ps` command shows that the containers are indeed running. The lack of output from `docker ps` without `sudo` suggests a permission issue. This could be caused by a Docker daemon socket that your user doesn't have permission to access.

    The default socket is typically located at `/var/run/docker.sock`. You can check the permissions on this socket with:

    ```bash
    ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
    ```

    The socket should have the `docker` group ownership, and your user should have permissions to access it as a member of the `docker` group.

5. **Docker Desktop Synchronization**: If Docker Desktop is not showing your containers, it could be a sign that Docker Desktop is not configured to manage the same Docker daemon that your command-line interface is using. Make sure Docker Desktop is set up to connect to the local Docker engine. This is usually the default, but if you have multiple Docker contexts or configurations, it might be connected to a different one.

6. **Restart Docker Desktop**: Sometimes, simply restarting Docker Desktop can help re-sync and show all running containers. It can also refresh the connection between the Docker CLI and the Docker Desktop interface.

7. **Reboot Your System**: If all else fails, a system reboot can often resolve issues with group changes and daemon connections. This ensures that all services are started fresh with the new configurations.

If, after all these steps, you still cannot run `docker ps` without `sudo` and Docker Desktop does not show your containers, you might need to look deeper into Docker's configuration files or consider reinstalling Docker Desktop.

////////////////
From the information provided, we can confirm a few things:

1. Your user `valerii` is indeed part of the `docker` group, as shown by the `groups` command output. This means you should have the necessary permissions to access Docker without using `sudo`.

2. The `newgrp docker` command seems to have been run correctly, but if `docker ps` still isn't showing any containers, it's possible that the new group has not been applied to the current shell session properly.

3. The Docker daemon seems to be running fine, as `sudo docker info` provides the correct output. It shows that Docker is active and has containers running.

4. The permissions on `/var/run/docker.sock` are correctly set to allow access to the `docker` group.

Given the correct group permissions and the Docker socket being accessible, you should be able to run Docker commands without `sudo`. Since it's not working, here are a few additional steps you could try:

-   **Restart the Terminal**: Completely close and reopen your terminal, then try running `docker ps` again without `sudo`.

-   **Restart Docker Service**: Sometimes, the Docker service might need to be restarted to apply the group changes. You can restart Docker using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

-   **Reboot Your System**: If the above doesn't work, a system reboot often resolves such issues by starting a new session with all the current user group memberships properly applied.

-   **Check for Docker Contexts**: Ensure that your Docker CLI is using the correct context. You can list Docker contexts with:

    ```bash
    docker context ls
    ```

    The current context should be pointing to the local Docker daemon. If it's not, you can switch to the default context with:

    ```bash
    docker context use default
    ```

After trying these steps, if `docker ps` still doesn't show any output without `sudo`, there might be a more specific issue with your Docker installation or user environment that requires deeper investigation.

Regarding Docker Desktop not showing your containers, ensure that Docker Desktop is configured to use the same Docker daemon. In Docker Desktop's settings, you should be connected to the Docker engine that is running on your local machine. If there are any discrepancies here, they would need to be resolved within Docker Desktop's settings or preferences.

Now it works . So just assume what we did to find the issue.

1. We did the command: `docker network ls` and the output was:
   valerii@valbot:~/LocalSites/laravel-10-blog-new$ docker network ls
   NETWORK ID NAME DRIVER SCOPE

   c0cf39af29b0 none null local
   From this command explain , please, what is network ? Why do we need it?
2. we did the command: `docker network inspect laravel-10-blog-new_sail`.

valerii@valbot:~/LocalSites/laravel-10-blog-new$ `
   From here we found out that we only have two containers: `"Containers": {
            "e77d5db342255f7902ada4cdd1876f5adc84e17ca7d823bd18725e2d3c7b36d5": {

                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },`
   so , the question how did you find out that we use from these three networks `aef87ff68417   laravel-10-blog-new_default   bridge    local
0784ec337d8f   laravel-10-blog-new_sail      bridge    local
2e420f4e11ed   laravel-10-new-blog_laravel   bridge    local` exactly the one `docker network inspect laravel-10-blog-new_sail`?
3. we did the command: `docker ps`. from this command we find out that we have `laravel-10-blog-new-adminer-1` running though on the wrong network to work. So we did the command: `docker inspect laravel-10-blog-new-adminer-1`.
   Based on the information provided by docker inspect laravel-10-blog-new-adminer-1, it appears that the Adminer container is connected to the laravel-10-blog-new_default network, not the laravel-10-blog-new_sail network that your MySQL container is on.
   we add the right network and everything is working now?

///// 4. Inspecting the Adminer Container:
docker inspect laravel-10-blog-new-adminer-1 provided detailed information about the Adminer container, including its network attachments. We found that it was connected to the laravel-10-blog-new_default network instead of the laravel-10-blog-new_sail network. This was the root cause of the issue - the Adminer container couldn't communicate with the MySQL container because they weren't on the same network.

5. Connecting Adminer to the Correct Network:
   After identifying the issue, we edited the docker-compose.yml file to ensure that Adminer was connected to the correct network (laravel-10-blog-new_sail). By doing so, Adminer was able to resolve the service name mysql to the correct container and establish a connection.
